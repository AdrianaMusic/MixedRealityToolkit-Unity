# Accessibilty system

The Accessibility system provides features that make Mixed Reality available to users of all abilities. The design of the accessibility system is to make features work automatically when enabled by the user. For example, a user may say "magnifier on" to enable dynamic hologram magnification based on gaze.

## Feature categories

The Mixed Reality Toolkit's Accessibility system defines four categories of features. Accessibilty features will assert support for one or more of these categories.

>[!Note]
>Not all of the example features are available in the Mixed Reality Toolkit. They are included for illustration and inspiration for possible future development.

  - Hologram magnification
  - Scene description
